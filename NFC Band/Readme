## Release History

  * Work in progress
  * The first attempt to create an app that makes use of NFC technology was using the MIT APP Inventor. It was not possible to read or write a NFC tag.Due to this impossibility we moved to the Android Studio and we were successful on writing a NFC tag. The first time on writing the tag the proccess was successful, but when tried to re-write we found it not possible yet. The solution to this was to format the tag and then write it as was the first time.
    The objective is to write a number provided by a label text on the app, the resulted text was inconsistent but when we tried to write a String, it went correct to the tag.
